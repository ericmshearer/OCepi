# OCepi ![](reference/figures/hex_sticker.png)

{OCepi} aims to provide a standardized approach to the mundane data
wrangling tasks for public health epidemiologists. The functions
included in this package can be broadly applied but were made
specifically for epidemiologists at county and State agencies. This
package addresses the following priorities:

- standardization of recoding demographic data, specifically:
  ethnicity/race, gender, sexual orientation, and age groups
- ggplot2 extensions to elevate data visualizations
- convert dates to weeks, months, and years following CDC MMWR schema
